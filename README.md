## Goal
The objective of this project is to apply in practice what has been learned during lectures with the purpose of becoming familiar with software engineering practices and able to address new software engineering issues in a rigorous way. The project includes two assignments:
- The preparation of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for a provided problem.
- The definition of the Design Document (DD) for the system considered in point 1 above.

The specification of the problem can be found [here](https://github.com/giacomolmb/FamaLombardo/blob/main/Assignment%20RDD%20AY%202021-2022.pdf).

#### RASD
The Requirements analysis and specification document (RASD) contains the description of the scenarios, the use cases that describe them, and the models describing the requirements and specification for the problem under consideration. We used a suitable mix of natural language, UML, and Alloy.

#### DD
The Design document (DD) contains a functional description of the system and any other view useful to provide. This document is a written report of the software product’s design, describing its overall architecture. Such design documents are given to the software development team to give them an overview of what needs to be built and how.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains all the files that we created in order to realize the final documents for the project. In particular the folders that you can find are:

- `DeliveryFolder`: contains the delivered final versions of documents.
- `Presentation`: contains the slides used for the final presentation of the project.
- `DD`: contains all the Tex files used to realize the final DD pdf.
- `RASD`:contains all the Tex files used to realize the final RASD pdf.
